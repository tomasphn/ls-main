a method that returns the sum of two integers
  create method that has two integer variables as parameters
  add both variables together
  return the result

a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
  create method that takes a single array as input
  create a string variable
  set it to equal the concatenation of the strings within the array
  return the string

a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:
  create a method that takes a single array as input
  for each element in the array
  if the index is even
  remove the element
  return the array

a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.
  create a method that takes two strings as input, one word and oine character
  set a variable to equal the word string split into an array by character
  for each element in the character
  if that element is equal to the input char 
  add its index to a new array
  if the index array has at least 3 items
  return the 3rd item in the array
  if not 
  return nil

a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:
  create a method that takes two arrays as input
  for each element in the first array 
  add the element to a new array
  then add an element from the second array with the same index as the current element
  return the new array
